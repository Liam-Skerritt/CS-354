4.1.1. Basic NAT

   With Basic NAT, a block of external addresses are set aside for
   translating addresses of hosts in a private domain as they originate
   sessions to the external domain. For packets outbound from the
   private network, the source IP address and related fields such as IP,
   TCP, UDP and ICMP header checksums are translated. For inbound
   packets, the destination IP address and the checksums as listed above
   are translated.

       (Addr-A)
       
   A Basic NAT router above may be configured to translate N-Pri
   into a block of external addresses, say Addr-i through Addr-n,
   selected from the external network N-Ext.
   
   Host-A, with address Addr-A is located in a private realm,
   represented by the network N-Pri. N-Pri is isolated from external
   network through a NAT router. Host-X, with address Addr-X is located
   in an external realm, represented by the network N-Ext.  NAT router
   with two interfaces, each attached to one of the realms provides
   transparent routing between the two realms. The interface to the
   external realm is assigned an address of Addr-Nx and the interface to
   private realm is assigned an address of Addr-Np.  Further, it may be
   understood that addresses Addr-A and Addr-Np correspond to N-Pri
   network and the addresses Addr-X and Addr-Nx correspond to N-Ext
   network.
