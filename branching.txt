 Branching and merging are done by typing the following in terminal:

- Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch:
    $ git checkout -b [name of your new branch]
    
- Change working branch to [name of your new branch](I think its when you want to switch between branches you already created):
    $ git checkout [name of your branch]
  
- Push the branch onto git:
   $ git push origin [name of your branch]
   
- View all the branches you have created:
   $ git branch
   
- To merge back into master:
   $ git checout master
   $ git merge [name of your branch]
   
- To delete branch:
   $ git branch -d [name of your branch]
