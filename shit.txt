Some stuff that i saw in the document that might be important:

--TCP/UDP sessions are uniquely identified by the tuple of (source IP address, source TCP/UDP port, target IP address, target TCP/UDP port)

--ICMP query sessions are identified by the tuple of (source IP address, ICMP query ID, target IP address)
   
--All other sessions are characterized by the tuple of (source IP address, target IP address, IP protocol).

--Address translations performed by NAT are session based and would include translation of incoming as well as outgoing packets belonging to that session. Session direction is identified by the direction of the first packet of that session.
